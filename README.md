## Project 

I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I replicated that design in HTML and CSS. 
I developed a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I completed through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

Once I'd successfully replicated the design mockup, I was encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it my own!
